### The Chatbot Program
The chatbot program I participated in was to use Node.js to develop a chatbot application on Wechat as an ordering application. Our clients were suppliers whose customers make orders from them. The advantage of the chatbot is to allow users directly and precisely tell the bot what they want within one line of key words and an order is made. At the same time, the interface is shallow: users just need to follow the company's public account and type in the order, without the need to download an app or open webpages.
