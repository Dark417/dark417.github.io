Hi universe, this is Xiaoxiao Lei writing in the Temple of Time.

### Background
I had robot programming experience from primary school to high school and won some rewards. It ignited my passion for learning computer science and built my algorithmical thinking. Although I majored in English in undergraduate, my fever for computer science and AI never fades. In recent years, I have learned advanced math and algorithm courses, as well as participated in some software development to accumulate experience and hone skills, such as a chatbot on Wechat. I will continue my pursuit in CS and AI. I am happy to share my learning experience with others. Please feel free to discuss with me.

### My AI Learning Experience
I have taken Machine Learning course on Coursera and first two courses in the series at Deeplearning.ai. Taking CS229 has been a struggle for me and I have done half of the lectures. I will continue to learn AI and build some interesting applications that can improve people's lives.
